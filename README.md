Welcome to the Zone. This application is an original project that allows users to access real time statistics of their favorite NFL team or player. The Zone is a front-end javascript application that leverages a hidden ESPN API to populate the sight and provide statistical visuals to the user. 

This project was designed and built in under 1 week.
